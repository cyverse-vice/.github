# CyVerse Visual Interactive Computing Environment

Welcome to the CyVerse VICE, where we keep our docker images for use in the [Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org) data science workbench. 
(Get it? a workbench, a VICE...)

We maintain these repositories with continuous integration. The containers should be auto-rebuilt every week and then pushed to our public/private container registry.
